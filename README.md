# Hi, I'm Krzysztof ZajƒÖc

Algorithmic Computer Science student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology  
I love learning, like for real.


## About Me

I‚Äôm a dedicated computer science student with a strong foundation in mathematics. I am still looking for my niche in Computer Science since I'm fascinated by most topics.
Apart from my interest in technology and science, I have a strong passion for the humanities, which I explore through my own radio show on [Radio Luz](https://radioluz.pl/).


## Skills

- **Languages:** [C++](), [Python](https://github.com/krzysztof400/university/tree/main/introduction_to_ai/emnist_dataset), [JavaScript](https://github.com/krzysztof400/university/tree/main/www_technologies/hangman-game)
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, [Express](https://github.com/krzysztof400/university/tree/main/www_technologies/rest_api)
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, Docker, [Linux](https://github.com/krzysztof400/dotfiles), Visual Studio Code
- **Other:** [Algorithm design](https://github.com/krzysztof400/university/tree/main/algorithms_and_data_structures), [Data structures](https://github.com/krzysztof400/university/tree/main/algorithms_and_data_structures), Problem-solving
- **Soft:** I have experience in [youth activism and social media](https://mrmw.um.wroc.pl/), [oxford debates](https://www.facebook.com/DebateLabPWr), [foreign exchange](esiee.fr) and as a self-employed tutor (20 hours/week). Each of these experiences required ‚Äî and allowed me to develop ‚Äî a variety of soft skills.


## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
- [**A-star for 15 puzzle**](https://github.com/krzysztof400/university/tree/main/introduction_to_ai/15_puzzle): Implementation of A-star algorithm for solving 15 puzzle, with lot of memory optimalisation - numbers of searched states exceeds 1e12
- [**Leetcode**](https://github.com/krzysztof400/Leetcode): A collection of algorithmic problems and solutions.
- [**Eliza chatbot**](https://github.com/krzysztof400/elizaChatbot): Simple chatbot based on Eliza technology, written in Haskell.

Feel free to explore more of my repositories to see the breadth of my work.
