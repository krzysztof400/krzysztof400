I am an algorithmic computer science student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology, currently participating in a foreign exchange program at ESIEE Paris.
My journey into computer science began out of a desire for intellectual rigor, as I found the humanities often oversimplified reality and allowed for rhetorical tricks, even among the most sincere.
I am passionate about mathematics, history, philosophy, and culture at large. I love meeting new people, listening to their perspectives, and diving deep into meaningful discussions.
You can explore more of my interests through my Instagram, Goodreads, Filmweb, and the articles linked in the Google Doc below.
